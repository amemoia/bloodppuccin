# bloodppuccin 
my personal catppuccin but like red
feel free to do whatever with this. light theme is still unfinished

# available themes
- vscode
- adwaita for steam

# installation
the `themes` folder contains the available themes. just download the files and drop them in the right folders

### vscode
1. download the `themes/vscode/` folder and rename it to `bloodppuccin`
2. drop it into your vscode extensions directory, on windows it's `%USERPROFILE%/.vscode/extensions`
3. restart vscode
4. `Bloodppuccin Dark` should now show up in the color theme picker

### adwaita for steam
1. download the adwaita skin from releases
2. drop `themes/adwaita-for-steam/bloodppuccin.css` into `Adwaita-for-Steam/adwaita/colorthemes/bloodppuccin/`
3. run `python install.py -c bloodppuccin -e windowcontrols/right-all`
